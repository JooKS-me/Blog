My Programming Experience:

Learned Visual Basic, simple algorithm and Digital Circuits in high school.

 In the first year of college, Participated in the ACM / XCPC training team. However, I have developed a strong interest in network and Linux.

In my second year of college, I started learning Java programming, and I was exposed to open source. I participated in [Summer 2021 of OSPP](https://summer.iscas.ac.cn/), provides an `opentelemetry-plugin` for shardingsphere to help ss-proxy connect to third-party tracing systems.

In my third year of college, I do an internship at [Meituan](https://about.meituan.com/en) as a Back-end R&D of AIoT. Then, I started learning cloud native after the internship, and participated in LFX Mentorship in KubeVela Community.

In the summer after my junior year, I participated in [Summer 2022 of OSPP](https://summer.iscas.ac.cn/) as a student to provide reactive stream support for dubbo. Also participated in GSoC 2022 as a mentor of ASF.

The story is still in progress. . .
