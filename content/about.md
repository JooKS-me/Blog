My Programming Experience:

Learned Visual Basic, simple algorithm and Digital Circuits in high school.

 In the first year of college, Participated in the ACM / XCPC training team. Then I realized I was a piece of shit... However, I have developed a strong interest in network and Linux when brushing codeforces. (Because in China, [codeforces.com](http://codeforces.com) is very slow to access, then you get the idea)

In my second year of college, I started learning Java programming, and I was exposed to open source. I participated in [Summer 2021 of OSPP](https://summer.iscas.ac.cn/).

In my third year of college, I skipped classes to do an internship at [Meituan](https://about.meituan.com/en) as a Back-end R&D of AIoT (nearly got kicked out of school). Then, I started learning cloud native after the internship, and participated in LFX Mentorship.

The story is still in progress. . .
