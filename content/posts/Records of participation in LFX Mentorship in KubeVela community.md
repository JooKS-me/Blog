## Before applying

Before joining the LFX Mentorship, I was still a Javaer and usually wrote some code about web and microservice middleware. However, through some technical speeches, I gradually found that cloud native is a trend, and many open source microservice middleware projects such as Apache Dubbo, Apache APISIX and other projects are actively transforming cloud native and integrating into the Kubernetes ecosystem. So I came up with the idea of learning cloud native related technology stacks.

Fortunately, I saw an introduction about LFX Mentorship on a forum. Not only can I participate in CNCF projects through this event, learn cloud native knowledge, but also gain some bonuses. So I started actively preparing for the LFX Mentorship in Spring 2022.

## Applying

In January of this year, I started learning Golang and Kubernetes. At the end of January, I saw the project "Enhance multi-cluster observability" proposed by the KubeVela community. And I happened to be familiar with observability before, so I started to apply for the KubeVela community project.

First, I searched and watched KubeVela related speech on the Internet, and got a general understanding of KubeVela and OAM. Then start reading the documentation on the official website and try to run some official demos on your own computer. Next, I downloaded the KubeVela-related code, tried to run the code in my IDE, and was able to debug with breakpoints. Then start reading KubeVela's core code and code related to this LFX Mentorship issue, and write some blog summaries.

In the process of doing the above things, I found some small problems in the documentation or code, so I submitted a pr to fix it and became a contributor of the KubeVela community.

After having a certain understanding of the issues of KubeVela and Mentorship issue, I started to write proposals and contacted the mentors. Later, we had a full discussion through chat software and audio meeting, and made some corrections to the proposal I wrote.

The application was later successfully approved.

## Enjoy the open source journey

After the event started, I started to finish the issue according to my plan.

In the process of writing code and receiving code reviews, I have gained a lot of knowledge that is not the same as before. When there is a question, the mentor is always patient to answer and always encouraging.

After making some contributions, according to the membership rules of the KubeVela community, I was also promoted to be a KubeVela Reviewer.

## After

I will continue to work on this project to learn and gain more when I have free time.

## Summary

It was a great event and I am very lucky to be able to participate.
